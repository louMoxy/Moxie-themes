Most small businesses don’t realise how much money they lose simply because Google has no idea where they actually *are.*

You could have the best products, the loveliest service, and a website that looks like it was handcrafted by angels — but if Google thinks you’re in “United Kingdom (unspecified)” instead of Croydon, Manchester, or Brighton… you’re basically invisible.

Local SEO isn’t glamorous.  
You won’t find anyone bragging about adding alt text to their location photos.  
But it quietly brings in the customers who live *near you* — you know, the ones most likely to buy from you.

Let’s make Google fall in love with your business and finally rank you where you deserve to be.

## What “Local SEO” Actually Means

Local SEO is just:  
**making sure your business shows up when someone nearby searches for what you offer.**

“Hair salon near me.”  
“Cake delivery Birmingham.”  
“Dog groomer Islington.”  

Google checks three things:

- **Relevance** — does your business actually match what they typed?  
- **Distance** — are you close to them?  
- **Prominence** — are you *known* locally (reviews, links, mentions, activity)?

You don’t need to be a marketer to nail this — you just need to do a handful of practical things consistently.

## Step 1: Sort Out Your Google Business Profile (GBP)

This one alone can skyrocket your visibility.

If you haven’t claimed your Google Business Profile, go do that immediately.  
It’s free. It’s powerful. It’s basically the key to the entire kingdom.

### How to optimise it properly

- Add **your real business name, exact address, phone number, and website URL**  
- Upload at least **10 high-quality photos** (space, products, staff, exterior)  
- Add **opening hours** (including special hours for holidays)  
- Choose **every relevant category** (you can have one main category + extras)  
- Add **products/services**, even if you list them on your website  
- Post updates weekly (offers, new products, events — treat it like a mini social feed)

### Why it matters  
Your GBP often appears *before your website* in search results.  
Neglecting it is like locking your shop door at lunchtime.

## Step 2: Make Your Website Shout Your Location

Google isn’t psychic.  
If your website never mentions where you operate, it can’t rank you locally.

### Add your location clearly on:

- Your **homepage** (“Serving clients across Kent & Sussex”)  
- Your **footer** (full address + clickable phone number)  
- Your **contact page** (map + directions)  
- Your **service pages** (“Bespoke landscaping services in Hertfordshire”)  

### Bonus points  
Create dedicated **location pages** if you serve multiple areas.  
Example:  
`/plumber-south-london`  
`/plumber-east-london`

One page per location — no stuffing them into one chaotic paragraph.

---

## Step 3: Nail Your On-Page SEO for Local Terms

This is the part everyone skips because it “sounds technical.”  
It isn’t. Promise.

### Focus on these:

- **Title tags** — “Mobile Dog Groomer in Hackney | HappyPaws”  
- **Meta descriptions** — short, punchy, and location-based  
- **H1 headings** — include what you do *and* where  
- **Alt text** — describe images and include the location where natural  
- **URL structure** — clean, simple, descriptive  

Example:  
`/manicure-salon-liverpool`

Write for humans first, sprinkle in keywords naturally.

---

## Step 4: Add Local Schema (If You Want to Be Fancy)

Schema markup is a small bit of code that helps Google understand your business details more clearly.

It’s optional, but brilliant.

Add **Local Business Schema** with fields like:

- Business name  
- Address  
- Phone number  
- Opening hours  
- Services  
- Map coordinates  

Your developer can add it in minutes — or you can use generators like Merkle’s.

It helps you appear in rich results and reinforces your local trust signals.

---

## Step 5: Collect Reviews Like They’re Gold (Because They Are)

Reviews are one of Google’s biggest ranking factors for local searches.

Aim for consistent, genuine, recent reviews.

### Tips:

- Ask every happy customer  
- Send them straight to your Google link  
- Reply to *every* review — even the weird ones  
- Add testimonials to your website for extra trust

And no, you don’t need 500 reviews.  
Ten real reviews beat fifty suspiciously identical ones.

---

## Step 6: Build Local Backlinks (Without Getting Spammy)

A backlink is simply another site pointing to yours.  
Local backlinks tell Google you’re a real business in a real community.

Ideas:

- Partner with local bloggers  
- Join business directories (not the dodgy ones — legit ones only)  
- Sponsor a local event  
- Collaborate with neighbouring businesses  
- Submit your business to local newspapers or “Top 10” lists  

Think: humans first, Google second.

---

## Step 7: Keep Your Business Details the Same Everywhere

Your:

- Name  
- Address  
- Phone number  

…must match **exactly** across:

- Your website  
- Google profile  
- Instagram  
- Facebook  
- Directories  
- Email signatures  
- Anywhere your business exists online  

If Google sees three different phone numbers and two versions of your address, it panics and ranks you lower.

## My Take (a.k.a. What I Do for Clients)

When I optimise websites for local search, I focus on:

- Making the brand feel hyper-local  
- Ensuring Google instantly understands where they operate  
- Tightening up the technical SEO  
- Making sure their content is clear, helpful, and location-specific  
- Optimising their Google Business Profile for maximum visibility  

It’s not about gaming Google — it’s about giving it the cleanest, clearest information possible so it trusts you.

The result?  
More traffic, more enquiries, more bookings — minus the headache.

## Final Thought

Local SEO isn’t a one-off task.  
It’s a quiet, ongoing, extremely profitable habit.

Do a bit each month, keep your details consistent, and treat your local customers well — Google sees everything.

When you get it right, your website becomes a digital signpost pointing straight to your business, 24/7.
