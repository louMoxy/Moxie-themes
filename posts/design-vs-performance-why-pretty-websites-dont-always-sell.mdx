Your site looks stunning. The colours slap, the fonts are on point, and the homepage feels like a mood board.  
So why aren’t people buying?

Because **pretty isn’t the same as profitable**. If your site is slow, confusing, or invisible to Google, it doesn’t matter how nice your gradients are — it won’t sell reliably.

Let’s fix that with a simple framework you can actually use.

---

## TL;DR

Design gets attention. Performance earns the click. Clarity gets the sale.  
Make it look good, yes — but make it **load fast, read clearly, and rank**.

Not sure where to start? Book an **SEO Audit** and I’ll tell you — plainly — what to fix first.

## The myth: “If it looks premium, it will convert”

Design matters — first impressions build trust. But **performance, clarity, and relevance** are what keep people clicking and buying.  
A site that takes 6 seconds to load or buries the add-to-cart button under art direction is just expensive wallpaper.

**Goal:** design for emotion, ship for speed, structure for search, and write for humans.

---

## What actually drives sales (in order)

1. **Speed** — fast sites get seen, explored, and trusted.  
2. **Clarity** — what you sell, why it’s good, and how to buy (above the fold).  
3. **Focus** — one clear action per screen; no cognitive gymnastics.  
4. **Proof** — reviews, real photos, trust markers.  
5. **Style** — the wrapper that makes it memorable (not the engine).

If you only optimise one thing this week, make it **speed**.

## How to balance design and performance (Shopify-friendly)

### 1) Keep hero sections light
- Use a single, well-compressed image or a CSS gradient instead of video.  
- Avoid heavy sliders; they tank LCP and no one waits for slide 3.  
- One headline, one subhead, one primary CTA. That’s it.

### 2) Ship images like a grown-up
- Export at the size you actually render.  
- Prefer modern formats (WebP or AVIF) where possible.  
- Lazy-load images below the fold.  
- Write descriptive alt text so search engines know what’s in the image.

### 3) Audit your apps and scripts
- Every app adds requests, CSS, and JS. Remove what you don’t use.  
- Prefer native Shopify 2.0 sections/blocks over plugins when you can.  
- Defer non-critical scripts until after the page is interactive.

### 4) Design for one action per screen
- Home: view a collection or shop “new in”.  
- Collection: filter then pick a product.  
- Product: choose variant then add to cart.  
If a section doesn’t move people to the next step, it’s decoration.

### 5) Write copy that sells, not just “sounds nice”
- Headline = what it is + who it’s for + why it’s great.  
- Bullets = benefits before features.  
- Kill filler like “we’re passionate” — prove it with specifics.

## Quick wins you can do today

- Replace the autoplay hero video with a still + gradient.  
- Compress your top 10 images and re-upload.  
- Set meaningful titles and meta descriptions (not “Home”).  
- Move reviews higher on product pages.  
- Trim the header to the essentials; fewer distractions = more clicks.  
- Test on mobile first. If it’s fiddly, fix it.

---

## A simple checklist for product pages

- Primary image loads under 2 seconds on mobile.  
- Clear price, variant selector, and a bold Add to Cart above the fold.  
- Benefits bullets in plain English.  
- Social proof visible without miles of scrolling.  
- Delivery/returns info one click away (no mystery fees at checkout).  
- Recommended products that actually relate.

---

## “But my brand needs motion and big visuals”

Same. You can have both — **style with restraint**:

- Use lightweight CSS transforms and opacity for motion instead of heavy JS.  
- Respect reduced-motion preferences and offer a site-wide “tone it down” toggle.  
- Animate one focal element at a time.  
- Load the fancy bits after the main content paints.

---

## Measuring what matters (not just vibes)

Open Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights and check these targets:

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): 2.5s or less  
- Interaction to Next Paint (INP): 200ms or less (or legacy FID ≤ 100ms)  
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): 0.1 or less

If you’re deep in the red, aesthetics aren’t your problem — **performance is**.
