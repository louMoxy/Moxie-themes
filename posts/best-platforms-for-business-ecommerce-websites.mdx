Choosing the right platform for your business website can feel like choosing a mortgage — confusing, overwhelming, and somehow everyone online is shouting at you about it.

But honestly?  
You don’t need to know every technical detail to make a smart decision.  
You just need the truth about what each platform is *really* good at — and where it will absolutely drive you mad.

Let’s break down the four platforms most small businesses rely on: **Shopify**, **Squarespace**, **Wix**, and **WooCommerce**.  
Each has its place, but one of them will make your life *much* easier depending on how you sell.

## What You Actually Need From an E-Commerce Platform

Before we get into the rankings, let’s make sure you’re judging these platforms on things that actually matter — not flashy features you’ll never use.

A strong e-commerce website should give you:

- A clean, mobile-friendly design  
- Easy product management  
- Smooth checkout experience  
- Reliable payments  
- Clear shipping setup  
- Good SEO foundations  
- Integrations for email, reviews, marketing, etc.  
- Zero headaches when adding or updating content  

If a platform can’t deliver these, it doesn’t matter how pretty the templates are.

## Shopify — The Gold Standard for Selling Online

Shopify is the Beyoncé of e-commerce.  
You can try to look elsewhere, but eventually you’ll come back.

### Why it’s great  
- **Purpose-built for selling** — everything is designed around commerce  
- **World-class checkout** (highest conversion rates of any platform)  
- **Hundreds of beautiful themes**  
- **Simple product management**  
- **Apps for everything** (subscriptions, bookings, bundles, etc.)  
- **Fast, secure hosting**  
- **Built-in reporting and analytics**  

For businesses that want to sell seriously — whether it’s candles or clothing — Shopify is unbeatable.

### Why it might not suit you  
It isn’t the cheapest option.  
And if you need extremely customised layouts, you may need a developer.  
But for most small businesses? Smooth sailing.

## Squarespace — The Aesthetic All-Rounder

Squarespace is perfect if your brand vibe is “clean, curated, and Instagram-friendly.”

It’s a visual dream.  
And it’s surprisingly solid for smaller e-commerce shops.

### Why it’s great
- **Gorgeous templates**  
- **Perfect for service + product hybrids** (e.g., salons selling merch)  
- **Easy drag-and-drop editor**  
- **Built-in marketing tools**  
- **Cheaper than Shopify**  

Squarespace shines when you want a site that’s *as beautiful as it is simple to manage.*

### Why it might not suit you  
It’s not built for complex stores.  
If you want advanced filtering, multi-warehouse stock, bundles, or app integrations… you’ll hit limits quickly.

---

## Wix — Flexible, but Can Get Messy

Wix gives you a lot of freedom.  
Like… a *lot.*  
Enough that beginners often design something that looks like a 2010 Myspace page by accident.

### Why it’s great  
- **Drag-anything-anywhere editor**  
- **Good for small catalogues**  
- **Built-in apps for bookings, memberships, events**  
- **Affordable pricing**  

### Why it might not suit you  
Wix’s design freedom can backfire.  
Sites get messy, slow, or inconsistent — and that hurts your SEO.  
It’s also not strong enough for businesses that plan to grow their online shop seriously.

---

## WooCommerce — Powerful, but Developer-Heavy

If you want *full control* and you’re comfortable hiring a developer (or fixing things yourself), WooCommerce can be a beast — in a good way.

It runs on WordPress and turns your site into a shop.

### Why it’s great  
- **Unlimited customisation**  
- **Huge plugin ecosystem**  
- **Great for large, complex shops**  
- **You own absolutely everything**  

### Why it might not suit you  
You’re responsible for hosting, security, updates, backups… everything.  
If something breaks, it’s on you (or your developer).  
This is not a hands-off platform.

## Which Platform Should *You* Use?

Here’s the simple version — no tech jargon, no overthinking:

- **Choose Shopify** if selling is your main goal and you want the most professional experience.  
- **Choose Squarespace** if you want something beautiful, simple, and perfect for smaller shops + service businesses.  
- **Choose Wix** if you’re on a tight budget and want flexibility (but not too many products).  
- **Choose WooCommerce** if you need total control and don’t mind hiring help.

## My Take (a.k.a. What I Recommend to Clients)

In 90% of cases, I recommend:

- **Shopify** for e-commerce-focused businesses  
- **Squarespace** for service-led brands that sell a few extras  
- **WooCommerce** only when the business needs deep custom development  

Shopify simply performs better for selling.  
Squarespace shines for visuals + simple shops.  
Wix works, but it’s not my go-to for growing businesses.

## Final Thought

Your website platform should make running your business easier — not turn you into your own IT department.

Choosing the right one saves time, boosts sales, and takes the stress out of managing your shop so you can focus on, you know… actually doing the thing you love.
