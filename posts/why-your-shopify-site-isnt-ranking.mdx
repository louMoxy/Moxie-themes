So, your Shopify site looks cute. The colours match, the fonts are vibing, and your friends keep saying “it’s so you.”  
But when you Google yourself? Page six. Maybe seven. Ouch.

Let’s fix that.

## The blunt truth

Most small business sites don’t rank because they’re built to *look* good, not to *work* well.  
Google doesn’t care how pink your buttons are — it cares whether your site’s fast, clean, and makes sense.

Here are five things likely holding your Shopify store back (and what to do about them):

---

### 1. You’re accidentally hiding from Google

If your store’s still got “noindex” lurking in your settings, Google’s politely pretending you don’t exist.  
In Shopify, go to **Online Store → Preferences** and make sure “Prevent search engines from indexing this site” is *unticked*.  
Yes, that’s an actual thing people forget.

---

### 2. Your product pages are clones

Copy-pasting product descriptions is the SEO equivalent of showing up to a party in the same outfit as ten other people.  
Write short, unique blurbs that describe what makes your product different — use your customer’s language, not AI mush.  
Google rewards originality; so do shoppers.

---

### 3. Your site’s slower than a dial-up connection

Oversized images and too many apps are silent conversion killers.  
Use **[Shopify’s speed report](https://www.shopify.com/uk/compare/sitespeed)** or a free tool like **[PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev)**.  
Compress images, ditch the plugins you don’t need, and aim for that “green” score.  
Remember: fast = found.

---

### 4. Your titles and meta descriptions are tragic

“Home” and “Shop” aren’t titles, they’re missed opportunities.  
Your homepage title should say who you are and what you sell — something like:  
> *“Y2K-Inspired Jewellery | Neon Accessories for Bold People – Brand Name”*  

That’s the stuff Google actually shows to humans.

---

### 5. You’ve got broken links everywhere

Old URLs, deleted products, dodgy referral links — all of it chips away at trust.  
Run a quick broken link check and redirect anything that’s gone walkabout.  
Broken links = broken credibility.

---

## How to fix all this (without crying)

If you’re tech-savvy, you can clean up most of this yourself.  
If you’d rather not spend your Friday night Googling “canonical tags,” book an **[SEO Audit](https://moxiethemes.com/services)** with me.

You’ll get a clear, no-jargon report showing exactly what’s wrong and how to fix it.  
No fluff, no panic — just the truth and a plan.

## Key takeaway

Your Shopify site isn’t doomed — it’s just misunderstood.  
A few smart tweaks and a little SEO love can turn it from *invisible* to *unmissable.*
